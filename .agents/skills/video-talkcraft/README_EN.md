**An agent skill for crafting high-quality voiceover-driven videos: word-level voiceover sync · 79 motion recipe cards · a 7-layer anti-slideshow shot system · triple-gate QA**

[中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

</div>

**video-talkcraft** is the voiceover-driven explainer installment of the
[video-shotcraft](https://github.com/Vincentwei1021/video-shotcraft) series:
an AI agent skill that turns Claude Code or Codex into a motion-design studio
for narrated explainer videos. Give it a narration script and a finished
voiceover, and it aligns word-level timestamps locally, storyboards every
semantic beat into a SHOTBOOK, then renders a polished explainer with
[Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) — kinetic type, evidence screenshots,
camera moves, plain-cut subtitles, and film-grade SFX, all locked to the voice.

> The methodology docs and recipe cards are written in Chinese — the toolkit is
> built Chinese-narration-first (mixed Chinese/English narration is fully
> supported). Agents read them natively.

## 🆕 What's new

**2026-09-02**

- **Motion workbench `workbench/`** — a CapCut-style post-production desk for finished videos: multi-track timeline,
  library (media / motion cards / SFX / backgrounds), schema-driven inspector, live preview and one-click **Export**.
  All 79 motion cards are parameterized (copy, colors, sizes, positions editable; timing vitals stay fixed).
  A narration video can be split into seven kinds of editable units — subtitles / transitions / environment /
  avatar / shots / voiceover / SFX. The skill opens it for you after delivery. → [**Illustrated guide (zh)**](workbench/GUIDE.md)

  <a href="workbench/GUIDE.md"><img src="workbench/docs/img/01-overview.png" alt="Workbench overview" width="720"></a>

- **Faster renders: shot-segmented master rendering** — `scripts/render_shots.mjs` renders per-shot segments in
  parallel (single-process inside each segment to keep rasterization consistent), then concatenates, mixes in the
  full audio track and asserts frame counts; changing one shot re-renders only that segment ± neighbours.
  `scripts/render_stills.mjs` renders batches of stills from a single bundle.
- **Fewer review tokens** — `scripts/contact_sheet.py` tiles QA frames into 3×4 sheets for the reviewer subagent;
  burst triples are extracted only at anchors flagged `"burst": true` (they used to be 2/3 of the review material).
- **One review round, then deliver** — after the machine gates pass, a single independent review round fixes
  P0/P1 and the video ships; further rounds are opt-in (3 max) instead of "loop until clean".

| Measured (201 s vertical video) | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Full first render | 13 min | 9 min |
| New video with audio after changing one shot | full re-render | 53 s |
| 43 sampled stills | 11 min | ~1 min |
| Reviewer reading 160 QA frames | ≈160k tokens / 21 min | ≈40k tokens / 7 min (sheets) |

- New card: community-contributed **douyin-follow-card** ([@scpcn01vision-oss](https://github.com/scpcn01vision-oss)) — 79 cards total.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Word-level voiceover sync** — `scripts/timestamps_cpu.py` aligns
  your script to the audio (FireRedASR2-CTC int8 by default, faster-whisper as
  the zero-download fallback). Benchmarked against a GPU forced aligner on a
  110s mixed-language narration: median per-character offset 20–40 ms,
  worst case 200 ms, zero false QA flags. Every motion beat anchors to the
  exact word.
- **79 motion recipe cards** — each with intent, parameters, known pitfalls,
  a copy-paste self-contained Remotion tsx source, and a runnable HTML
  preview — browse them all in the
  [online Gallery](https://vincentwei1021.github.io/video-talkcraft/) or
  locally with `open gallery/index.html`. Kinetic type, data shots, evidence
  tours, six motion-carry transitions, a long-take world canvas, host
  compositing, and more.
- **A 7-layer anti-slideshow system** — continuous camera curves, parallax
  planes, idle/yield lifecycle, breathing environment. Statically frozen
  frames are structurally impossible (and automatically detected if they
  slip through).
- **Layout discipline that survives review** — semantic-beat storyboarding,
  on-screen element budgets, whitespace anchors, pivot-sentence cut rules,
  and face safety zones measured by real detection
  (`scripts/face_bbox.py`), not by eye.
- **Triple-gate QA** — automated stillness detection, per-cue SFX energy
  verification on a solo track, and an independent-reviewer pass armed with
  anchor frames (plus burst triples at state-switch anchors, which catch
  time-domain defects single frames can't show).

## 🚀 Quick start

**The most direct way: hand the repo link to your agent.**
In Claude Code / Codex or a similar agent, just say:

```text
Install this skill for me: https://github.com/Vincentwei1021/video-talkcraft
```

Or install with the [skills](https://skills.sh/) CLI / manually:

```bash
npx skills add Vincentwei1021/video-talkcraft
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vincentwei1021/video-talkcraft.git
cd video-talkcraft
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/skills/video-talkcraft   # Claude Code
# or
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.codex/skills/video-talkcraft    # Codex
```

Environment (the agent will set this up as needed):

- Node 18+ (Remotion render; `npm install` inside the per-video project)
- Python 3.10+ and `pip install zhconv pypinyin sherpa-onnx soundfile numpy`
  for the timestamp pipeline (first use downloads the 767 MB FireRedASR2-CTC
  model once — URLs in `scripts/timestamps_cpu.py`; or use
  `--backend whisper` to skip the manual download)
- ffmpeg

Then make requests like:

```text
Use video-talkcraft to turn this narration script + voiceover.wav into a video.
Make a 100-second explainer about <topic>; here is the script and the audio.
```

## 🎞 What you bring vs. what it does

| You bring (inputs) | The skill does |
| --- | --- |
| Narration script | Word-level timestamp alignment, with per-sentence QA flags |
| Finished voiceover — any TTS or human recording | SHOTBOOK storyboarding: semantic beats, layer matrices, layout budgets |
| Optional host footage — ordinary video works (keying + face-zone tooling included; green screen keys cleanest) | Remotion implementation on four global systems (camera / parallax / yield / environment), transitions, SFX placement |
| Optional B-roll / screenshots | Render + triple-gate QA (machine gates all green + one independent review round with P0/P1 fixed, then deliver; optional extra rounds, 3 max), loudness-normalized delivery |

## 📦 What's included

## ❓ FAQ

**What is video-talkcraft?**
An open-source AI agent skill (for Claude Code / Codex) that turns a narration
script plus a finished voiceover into a fully animated, voiceover-driven
explainer video. It is
not an editor and not a template site — the agent reads the methodology, picks
motion recipe cards, writes [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) code, and
runs triple-gate QA to deliver a publish-ready explainer.

**What kinds of videos can it make?**
Landscape, voiceover-driven explainer videos: knowledge explainers, product
reviews, news breakdowns, opinion commentary. Designed Chinese-narration-first; mixed
Chinese/English narration is fully supported.

**What do I need to provide?**
A narration script (text) and a finished voiceover (any TTS or human
recording); host footage and B-roll are optional.

**Is it free?**
Free for personal, educational, and research use (PolyForm Noncommercial
1.0.0), and the videos you produce belong to you; commercial use of the
toolkit itself requires prior authorization (see below).
