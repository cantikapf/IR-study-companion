## What is diplomacy?

Diplomacy is the main way that countries interact with each other. It involves communication and negotiations between professional diplomats and government officials to help countries achieve their foreign policy goals without using propaganda or force. 

The key purpose of diplomacy is to enable countries to secure the objectives of their foreign policy without resorting to conflict or violence. Diplomacy achieves this through discussions and negotiations between diplomats and officials which aim to build agreements and identify shared interests. It provides a more civilized alternative to brute force for countries to deal with their differences and advocate for themselves on the world stage.

Effective diplomacy depends on diplomats' specialized skills in communication, negotiation, persuasion and representation to advance their country's interests. At its core, diplomacy facilitates peaceful interactions between nations.

## Diplomacy: the Functions

Diplomacy serves several key functions in foreign relations between states and other international actors. 

### Representing Interests and Conducting Negotiations

One of the core functions of diplomacy is representing a state's interests and conducting negotiations with other parties. Professional diplomats engage in discussions and negotiations aimed at identifying shared interests as well as areas of disagreement. The goal is to achieve the objectives of their state while avoiding conflict. Through communication and bargaining, diplomats try to reach mutually beneficial agreements.

### Gathering Information 

Diplomats also play a key role in gathering information about the foreign policy goals and priorities of the states or actors they interact with. They identify and evaluate the aims of the receiving state. This intelligence gathering function provides critical insights to inform their own state's strategic decisions.

### Expanding Ties

Another function of diplomacy involves expanding political, economic, and cultural relationships between two countries. Diplomats aim to develop stronger bilateral ties through exchanges, cooperation initiatives, trade agreements, and other means. This fosters greater interdependence and understanding.

### Facilitating International Law

Diplomacy serves as a vehicle for observing international law and norms between states. Negotiations can lead to formal agreements or treaties codifying legal obligations. Diplomats facilitate dialogue on upholding shared rules and principles of international conduct. This function upholds global order and stability.

## Difference between diplomacy, negotiation and foreign policy

Diplomacy, negotiation, and foreign policy are related concepts with some key differences.

**Diplomacy** refers to communication and engagement between professional diplomats and officials to secure agreements and represent national interests. The key actors are professional diplomatic agents, ambassadors, envoys, and international organizations. Diplomacy operates through traditional diplomatic channels and missions.

**Negotiation** focuses on discussions between parties, either states or non-state actors, designed to identify common interests and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. Negotiation is a tool used in diplomacy.

**Foreign policy** consists of the strategies and actions taken by national governments to achieve objectives and protect interests in the international arena. Foreign policy is formulated by high-level government officials and leaders. 

The key differences:

- **Actors**: Diplomacy involves diplomatic agents and international organizations, negotiation involves varied parties and stakeholders, foreign policy is conducted by national governments.
- **Channels**: Diplomacy utilizes formal diplomatic channels and missions, negotiation can be more informal, foreign policy decisions flow through formal state institutions and processes.
- **Scope**: Diplomacy aims for agreement and cooperation, negotiation seeks to advance interests through discussions, foreign policy establishes high-level strategy and policy.

So in summary, diplomacy and negotiation are tools and processes that can be used to advance the goals of a state's foreign policy. Diplomacy focuses on formal engagement between professional diplomats, while foreign policy is the broader strategy set by national governments regarding the external world.

## The origin of diplomacy as practice

The practice of diplomacy, despite the term itself being coined in the 18th century, has roots in ancient history. Edmund Burke, a British statesman, introduced the term in 1796, derived from the Greek word 'diploma,' which referred to official state documents. These documents were handled by individuals who later came to be known as diplomats.

In the 17th century, the term 'diploma' became associated specifically with treaties governing international relations. Ambassadors, envoys, and officials attached to foreign missions, collectively referred to as the 'diplomatic body,' played crucial roles in negotiating these agreements.

However, the essence of diplomatic practice predates the terminology, as rulers engaged in activities such as exchanging messages, offering gifts, negotiating treaties, forming alliances, signing peace agreements, and mediating disputes. This fundamental diplomatic activity was observed in various regions outside Europe.

Interestingly, the roots of diplomacy trace back even further in time, with the earliest known diplomatic document being a 2500 BC cuneiform tablet – a letter exchanged between the Mesopotamian kingdom of Ebla and the kingdom of Amazi.

Furthermore, ancient Indian civilization, as outlined in the Arthashastra, detailed different classes of diplomatic representatives with varying levels of authority. This highlights that, while the term 'diplomacy' is relatively recent, the practice itself has a rich and diverse history spanning thousands of years across the globe.

## Changes in Modern Diplomacy

Diplomacy has changed in several key ways in the modern era:

- **Expansion of actors involved**: Diplomacy no longer involves just governments. A wide range of new actors are now involved, including private sector firms, multinational corporations (MNCs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and regional and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).
- **Broader scope of subject matter**: The content and issues addressed through diplomacy have expanded far beyond traditional "high" foreign policy matters. Diplomacy now covers a very broad array of public policy sectors and government activities.
- **More levels of engagement**: Diplomatic activity now takes place at the local, domestic, bilateral, regional, and global levels. Globalization has reduced the divisions between these levels.
- **Developments in foreign relations apparatus**: The infrastructure and processes of foreign relations have evolved, including new technologies, expanded bureaucracy, and more robust international institutions.
